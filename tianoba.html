            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Building Project for Tianoba Pre-School and Lower Primary</strong> aims to foster holistic development for the children of Tianoba through quality education and Christlike discipleship. This initiative is vital in addressing the educational needs of the community, which currently lacks adequate schooling facilities.</p>

        <div class="bg-section">
            <h2>Community Demographics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Population:</strong> The community comprises over 2,000 adults and approximately 600 children of school-going age.</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Tianoba is situated in the North East Region of Ghana, approximately 14.7 km (9.1 mi) from Nalerigu, the regional capital, and around 536 km (333 mi) from Accra, the national capital.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-section">
            <h2>Socioeconomic Profile</h2>
            <p>The primary occupation within the community is agriculture, with residents primarily engaged in subsistence farming to support their families.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-section">
            <h2>Educational Needs</h2>
            <p>Currently, the absence of a school in Tianoba necessitates that children walk about 30 minutes to the nearest educational facility. In response to this pressing need, missionaries have initiated a temporary school under a tree to provide immediate educational access for the children.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-section">
            <h2>Community Challenges</h2>
            <p>The community faces several challenges, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of electricity</li>
                <li>Absence of healthcare facilities</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-section">
            <h2>Community Participation</h2>
            <p>The community has generously allocated land for the establishment of the school. The missionaries plan to construct a two-unit classroom using locally sourced materials to accommodate over fifty children committed to their education. However, essential materials such as cement, wood, and roofing sheets cannot be sourced locally, necessitating external support.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-section">
            <h2>Cultural and Ethnic Diversity</h2>
            <p>The majority of the population in Tianoba belongs to the Mamprusi ethnic group. The community predominantly practices Islam and traditional worship; however, the number of Christians has been steadily increasing due to missionary efforts over the past few years. A cultural challenge exists, as many parents prefer to involve their children in farming activities rather than sending them to school. The absence of educational facilities within the community further exacerbates this issue, making it difficult for children to pursue their education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-section">
            <h2>Call to Action</h2>
            <p>To make this vision a reality, we seek partnerships and financial support to acquire the necessary building materials for the school. Together, we can provide the children of Tianoba with the education they deserve, ensuring a brighter future for the community.</p>
